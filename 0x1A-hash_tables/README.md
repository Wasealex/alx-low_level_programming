this project is a HASH-Table meaning HASH-function with array
for storing and retriving data with constant time complexity
a hash function is going to take an input then map it to a loction
in an array
criteria for ideal hashtable
1) calling a hash function on the same input should always produce the same output
2) hash function needs to be fast
3) hash function should be random
